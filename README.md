# Introduction

This program is a simple snake game. I made it when I was learning to program, back in 2010. In fact, it is my first, ever, programming project (beyond simple _helloworld_ programs).

Originally, it was kept on Dropbox, but now I decided to recover it from there and host it on GitHub.

It's quite a quirky game, but I am proud of it and fondly remember making it. Here is a screenshot from the simple gameplay.

# Running from Source Code

This game was written in Python 2. To run the game from the source code, execute the following commands to install `pygame` locally with _virtualenv_. These steps are known to work on Ubuntu 20.04.

```bash
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install pygame
python snake.py
```

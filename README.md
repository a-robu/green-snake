# Introduction

This is repository holds the first thing I ever programmed (beyond simple hello world programs). Originally it was kept on Dropbox and I recovered it from there.

It's quite quirky, but I have a fond memory of making it. Here is a screenshot from the simple gameplay.

# Running from Source Code

This game is written in Python 2. To run the game from the source code, execute the following commands to install `pygame` locally with _virtualenv_.

```bash
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install pygame
python snake.py
```
